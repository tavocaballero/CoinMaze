# CoinMaze
Collect coins and solve a maze in VR.

CoinMaze was created using UNITY 3D and is using the Google VR SDK. After downloading, you need to create a build for Android or iOS device. Once it's build on your mobile device you can experience using a Google Cardboard.

```It is part of the UDACITY VR Nanodegree program.```

## Instructions

The game is meant to be used with a Google Cardboard.
Users need to navigate through a Waypoint system and find a Key to unlock the gate of the main Temple to complete the game.
Along the way users can be collecting coins.

## Next steps

As it is now, users can complete the maze and start over. However, new scenes will be added with different maze layouts.
Also, users can find coins and click on the cardboard button to 'collect' them. However, there's currently nothing showing the user how many coins they have or if they have the key. 
I will update the UI to present those pieces of information to the user.
